## Summary of the Workflow adopted for this homework
1. **Edited the `README.md` file** directly within the existing structure.
2. **Made regular commits** to track the changes and maintain version control.
3. **Commited the changes** back to the remote repository using `git push`.
4. I didn't create a new branch as I was editing the repository that was already set up for this assignment.
